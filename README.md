# Color-Identification-in-Images
This CV model identifies the colors in images. It has two features. One of its feature is that it can create a pie chart of colors available on a image as per their significance in the image. and other one is that you can provide a color as input and it will filter the images in its database and provide the images based on that particular color as output.

Here, I have used machine learning algorithm, KMeans, to extract colors from a give image. I will use OpenCV2 for image manipulation, apply KMeans to identify the major colors and then plot the information using Matplotlib.
